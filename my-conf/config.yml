        title: "Living without Fear and Worry"
        description: "In this seminar we talk about the bad habit of worry and the fear that holds us back. We will learn some techniques how to quiet the mind and do things from a place of faith rather than a place of fear.   We will also discuss understanding fear and how to release it from our bodies. All the negative energies which block us can be overcome in order to flow more easily with the universe and manifest the life we want rather than draw to us the experiences which we most fear and worry about.  This will include using techniques from NLP, EFT and Metaphysics.  Now is your time to break from from the thoughts and feelings that feel \"uncontrollable\". Take back control of your mind and find more peace."

        title: "Unconditional Living (co-creating the world you want)"
        description: "In this seminar we learn about about our true ability to create the world around us by learning to live unconditionally. We will discuss tools to use in order to create the results we want by focusing on metaphysical techniques which allow us to arrive there without being dependent on prior events.  When we empower ourselves to create a paradigm shift in our mind, the reality which we know will change forever.  We can choose the reality we want and attract to us the experiences, people and situations we desire. Choose the brush you want to paint your life with and let's get creative!!!"
