      bio: "Dr. Auburn E. Ellis, founder of Studio 54oo, is a visual artist with studios in KC & Chicago. Painting, drawing and collage are an essential part of the artist’s practice as she explores the use of traditional mediums for art reflective of the African Diaspora.  Rooted in ceramics and three-dimensional design, her work pushes the boundaries of texture and rhythm. Currently, she is working on an art series related to yoga instruction. As a 300-hour Certified Yoga Instructor, making art based on these teaching experiences is an important part of merging studio practice. Specializing in Kemetic Yoga, the realization that yoga originated in Africa (Ancient Egypt or Kemet) was a logical teaching path and extension to her doctoral dissertation."

        title: "Living without Fear and Worry"
        description: "In this seminar we talk about the bad habit of worry and the fear that holds us back. We will learn some techniques how to quiet the mind and do things from a place of faith rather than a place of fear.   We will also discuss understanding fear and how to release it from our bodies. All the negative energies which block us can be overcome in order to flow more easily with the universe and manifest the life we want rather than draw to us the experiences which we most fear and worry about.  This will include using techniques from NLP, EFT and Metaphysics.  Now is your time to break from from the thoughts and feelings that feel \"uncontrollable\". Take back control of your mind and find more peace."
