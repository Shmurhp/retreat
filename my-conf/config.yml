        title: "Living without Fear and Worry"
        description: "In this seminar we talk about the bad habit of worry and the fear that holds us back. We will learn some techniques how to quiet the mind and do things from a place of faith rather than a place of fear.   We will also discuss understanding fear and how to release it from our bodies. All the negative energies which block us can be overcome in order to flow more easily with the universe and manifest the life we want rather than draw to us the experiences which we most fear and worry about.  This will include using techniques from NLP, EFT and Metaphysics.  Now is your time to break from from the thoughts and feelings that feel \"uncontrollable\". Take back control of your mind and find more peace."
